F4/FMPAC Adapter Board for Yamaha YIS805 version 1.0
Copyright (c) 2019 RBSC


The board relocates the Z80 socket, that is partially covered by YIS805's power supply casing to a different place and allows
to install additional hardware into the Z80 CPU socket. The board is primarily designed to install the RBSC's F4/FMPAC combo
board. However, other boards can be also installed, for example the 2mb RAM expansion made by Andrey Koryakin.


Assembling
----------

Assembling of the board is very easy. Just soder two 20-pin headers and the 40-pin DIP socket onto the board as shown on the
pictures. It's advised to clean up the board from flux after soldering.


Installation
------------

The board must be installed into the default CPU socket (socket installation must be done beforehand) from one side and onto 2
special holders from the other side. The holders must be glued to the motherboard with the help of 2-sided sticky tape. The
board must be then secured on top of the holders with 2 small screws. The 3D models of the holders can be found here:

Please note that if the adapter board is not properly secured, it may detach from the motherboard and cause damage to the computer's
internals!
